# Weather App

## Notes

- **API Key:**  
  Make sure to replace the OpenCage API key with your own key if you want to run the project locally. The key is used in the `Search` function to get geolocation data for the entered city.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The app includes error handling to display appropriate messages in case the city is not found or there is an issue with fetching weather data.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout is fully responsive, so it will adapt to different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop.

## Future Enhancements

- **Add more detailed weather information** like UV index, air quality, etc.
- **Allow users to save their favorite cities** for quick access.
- **Implement user authentication** to personalize the weather experience.
