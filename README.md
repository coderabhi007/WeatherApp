Notes
API Key: Make sure to replace the OpenCage API key with your own key if you want to run the project locally. The key is used in the Search function to get geolocation data for the entered city.
Error Handling: The app includes error handling to display appropriate messages in case the city is not found or there is an issue with fetching weather data.
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, so it will adapt to different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop.
Future Enhancements
Add more detailed weather information like UV index, air quality, etc.
Allow users to save their favorite cities for quick access.
Implement user authentication to personalize the weather experience.
